# Sage Scripts for Collections of Cells

This directory contains:

1. a SageMath script `collection_cells_generator.sage` â€“ generates all weakly connected collections of cells (polyplets) of a given rank, also up to symmetries.

2. The generated lists of polyplets are already available as `.txt` files. These files are ready to use with the Macaulay2 code.
