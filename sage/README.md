# Sage Scripts for Collections of Cells

This directory contains:

1. a SageMath script `collection_cells_generator.sage` â€“ generates all weakly connected collections of cells (polyplets) of a given rank, also up to symmetries.

2. The generated lists of polyominoes and polyplets are already available in the `macaulay2/` directory as `.txt` files and, for larger datasets, in `.zip` archives. These files are ready to use with the Macaulay2 code.
