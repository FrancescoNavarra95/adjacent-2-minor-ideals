# Collections of Cells and Adjacent 2-Minors Ideals

This repository contains computational tools to study **adjacent 2-minor ideals** of collections of cells, a class of binomial ideals first introduced by Jürgen Herzog and Takayuki Hibi in *"Ideals generated by adjacent 2-minors"* (Journal of Commutative Algebra).

## Overview

Given a collection of cells $\cP$, the **adjacent 2-minor ideal** is generated by the $2 \times 2$ minors corresponding to the cells of $\cP$.

Each collection is encoded as a list `Q`, whose elements are the cells, represented by their diagonal corners.

 For example:
```
      __
   __|__|
  |__|__|

 ``` 
is encoded as:  Q={{{1,1},{2,2}},{{2,1},{3,2}},{{2,2},{3,3}}}

## Structure of the Macaulay2 Script

The main script, `Adjacent.m2`, is organized into three sections:

### 1. `AdjIdeal(Q)`
Constructs the adjacent 2-minor ideal of a given collection `Q` of cells.

### 2. `TestRadicality(L)`
Tests whether the ideals associated with all collections in the list `L` are radical, using the standard `radical()` function of Macaulay2.

### 3. `TestBinomialRadicality(L)`
Tests radicality using the `binomialRadical()` command from the package **Binomials**, optimized for binomial ideals.

The functions print progress every 100 iterations and automatically save the list of non-radical collections to a text file named  
`NoRadical_<n>.txt`, where `<n>` is the number of cells in the collection.

## Directories

### **SageMath/**
- Contains the code to compute the set `L` of all collections of cells of a fixed rank `n`.  
- The scripts generate collections up to symmetries.


### **Outputs/**
- Contains the Python script `Reppresentation_Polyo_from_List.py`,  
which takes as input a file `input_collections.txt` and generates images of the corresponding collections.  
- This directory also includes:
- The results of the radicality tests.
- The folder `Output_pictures.zip` containing all non-radical collections.

## How to Use

### 1. Download the repository
- On GitHub, click **Code → Download ZIP**.  
- Extract the archive locally to obtain the directories `Sage/`, and `Outputs/`.

### 2. Prepare the data files
- Place the `.txt` files containing the collections (generated via SageMath) in the same directory as `Adjacent.m2`.

### 3. Run the code in Macaulay2
Open Macaulay2 and load the required package and script:

```m2
loadPackage "Binomials";
load "Adjacent.m2";
 
### 4. Test radicality

Load a file containing a list of collections and run one of the test functions:

```m2
L = value get("weak_polyplets_n8.txt");
time TestBinomialRadicality(L);
```
