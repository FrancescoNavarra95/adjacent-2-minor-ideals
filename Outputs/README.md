## Contents

1. **Text files** — contain the collections of cells whose adjacent 2-minors are non-radical.  
2. **`Output_pictures.zip`** — compressed folder including graphical representations of all collections of cells whose adjacent 2-minors are non-radical.  
3. **Python script** `Rappresentation_polyomino_from_list.py` — used to visualize the collections of cells.  
4. **`Computations_M2.zip`** — compressed folder containing the outputs of the *Macaulay2* computations.

### Important
From the collections of cells in `Output_pictures.zip`, we extracted all **minimal non-radical collections** up to rank 8.  
These specific examples are described and analyzed in the accompanying article.
